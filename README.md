# Go (Golang Template)

## About

Go get started with Golang or Go. I feel like Golang will end up like Ruby on Rails and most people will forget about it. I hope Go gets going, but my hopes are low

## Includes

The following code

```go
package main

// imports
import (
	"fmt"
)


func main() {
	// choose any number
	number := 1

	fmt.Println(number)
}
```
